# BetterGW2
A QoL tool for Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare 2. Mainly for easily changing the FOV.

Installation Guide:
For the easiest installation, download the BetterGW2.exe file and run it. It has the same code as the Python file but you can use it without having Python installed.
When using the .py version, make sure to have at least Python 3.10.0, as well as tkinter installed.
To install tkinter, simply open your command prompt and type "pip install tk" and everything should work.

Avira or other antivirus services will probably detect the .exe file as malicious and put it in quarantine (same happened to me), probably because the file changes values in another file, though I am not sure. If you don't trust a random guy on the internet uploading stuff for GW2 (as you normally should), just download the .py file and you're on the safe side.

This tool works for Windows as well as MacOS.
